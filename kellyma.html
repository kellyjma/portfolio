 <h2> Tuesday 6/20 Reflection </h2>
 <p> Today we learned about loops and variables in Python. We had wrote some could that would classify if a number is odd or even. It was easy to write and it was cool to be able to write our own program that would work. It was also fun to learn a new language. The code was easy to understand because it was similar to what I have learned before about coding. I liked how you could use loops to repeat things over and over so you did not have to write the code multiple times. When we debugged our program, it felt sastisfying and relieving to get the program to work because we were able to overcome an obstacle. It was frustrating to debug because we would try multiple ways, but each solution would not work. So we had to keep trying until we finally got the right solution. </p>
  
 <h2> Friday 6/23 Reflection </h2>
 <p> A list is a set of items that are mutuable. For example [1, 2, 3, 4] is an example of a list. With a list you can input values or take out values. Lists are useful because it is a way for you to store values in a certain place that you can access and use. All the groups I had worked with worked well. In each group, everyone was able to share their ideas and contribute if we were disucssing an idea. Also everyone was very flexibe with each other and open to new ideas. I like using loops in Python because they are a simple way to repeat actions multiple times. </p>
 
 <h2> Monday 6/26 Reflection </h2>
 <img src="IMG_4551.JPG" alt="Robotics" style="width:300px;height:250px;">
 <p> I think robots are cool in technology because they alow us to do things that we would not be capable of. I am excited about the future of robotics because it could make life easier for us and could be beneficial. Although I am nervous because robots could also be potentially used for harm and could invade people's privacy. Robots could also malfunction and put our lives in danger. The groups worked well because we were all able to contribute our ideas and help each other out when we were stuck. We could improve by including everyone and making sure everyone had a turn to interact with the circuits.</p>
 
 <h2> Thursday 6/29 Reflection</h2>
 <img src="IMG_4568.JPG" alt="Robotics2" style="width:200px;height:250px;">
 <p> Today we used infrared sensors on the robot. These sensors would sense its surroundings and the robot would then go in another direction if there was something blocking the sensor</p>
