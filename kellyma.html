 <h2> Tuesday 6/20 Reflection </h2>
 <p> Today we learned about loops and variables in Python. We had wrote some could that would classify if a number is odd or even. It was easy to write and it was cool to be able to write our own program that would work. It was also fun to learn a new language. The code was easy to understand because it was similar to what I have learned before about coding. I liked how you could use loops to repeat things over and over so you did not have to write the code multiple times. When we debugged our program, it felt sastisfying and relieving to get the program to work because we were able to overcome an obstacle. It was frustrating to debug because we would try multiple ways, but each solution would not work. So we had to keep trying until we finally got the right solution. </p>
